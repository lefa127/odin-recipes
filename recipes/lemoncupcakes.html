        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Here is a lemon cupcake recipe I use for beautifully delicious treats. 
            Ideally, you'd use buttercream frosting to top the cupcakes, 
            but I tried these with lemon cream icing for a less buttery option, 
            and they were perfect! These cupcakes are truly lighter than air and will melt in your mouth.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1> 
        <h4>Cupcakes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups self-raising flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk, divided</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Lemon Cream Icing:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups chilled heavy cream</li>
            <li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Line 30 cupcake pan cups with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Prepare the cupcakes: Sift flour and salt together in a bowl. 
                Beat butter and sugar together in another bowl with an electric 
                mixer until light and fluffy. Add in eggs one at a time, 
                beating after each addition to incorporate. 
                Mix in lemon zest and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Gently beat flour mixture into butter mixture, 
                1/3 at a time, alternating with 1/2 of the milk 
                and 1/2 of the lemon juice after each of the first two additions 
                of flour. Beat until just combined; do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Fill the prepared cupcake liners with batter, 3/4 full, 
                and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 
                in the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes. 
                Let the cupcakes cool in the pans before removing them to 
                finish cooling on a rack, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the icing: Beat cream in a chilled bowl 
                with an electric mixer set on low until cream begins to thicken. 
                Add confectioners' sugar and lemon juice, a little at a time, 
                beating after each addition, until fully incorporated. 
                Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until the icing forms 
                soft peaks, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread icing on cooled cupcakes. Refrigerate leftovers</li>
        </ol>
