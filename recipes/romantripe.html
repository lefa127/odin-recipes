        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>If beef tripe is prepared following this method, it has a pleasantly mild but distinct flavor. 
            When it comes to great sauces for dipping crusty Italian bread, it doesn't get any better than this.</p>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Fill a large stockpot with 5 quarts cold water, tripe, vinegar, 2 teaspoons salt, vanilla, and bay leaf; bring to a boil over high heat. Skim off any foam, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Transfer tripe to a plate and set aside to cool. Reserve 2 cups cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and onion; cook and stir until pancetta is browned and onion is translucent, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in marinara sauce, 1 cup cooking liquid, and pepper flakes. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut tripe into 1-inch cubes; add to sauce and stir to combine. Simmer for 30 minutes, adding remaining 1 cup cooking liquid if needed.</li>
            <li>Stir in garbanzo beans and mint, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano over top.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
